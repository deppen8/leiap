Introduction
============

The ``leiap`` package was written for the `Landscape, Encounters, and
Identity Archaeology (LEIA) Project`_.

Installation
------------

The package is not uploaded to PyPI yet, so to the easiest way to
install is to do so directly from the distribution file. Typically, if
you want to use a conda environment, you would use these steps:

1. Download the files in the ``dist`` folder of the repository
2. Activate the conda environment you want to use, e.g.,

.. code:: bash

   $ source activate my_env

3. Navigate to the location where you saved the ``dist`` files, e.g.,

.. code:: bash

   $ cd /MyFiles/Downloads/

4. ``pip install`` the package (see `Installing from local archives`_
   for more info)

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install ./dist/leiap-0.1.1.tar.gz
